# NLP-Project
The project for sentiment analysis for the course CS476 (Dr. Sakhr)
this was work on by group of five students:
1. Serry Sibaee
2. Sattam Al Ammar 
3. Saleh Mohaimeed 
4. Ibrahim Bazzoun 
5. Ali Al Basoudan

The distribution of the files is as following: 
1.	Main file is "project work" where the main code.
2.	Second file is "File number 2" is where we did the LSTM (because we needed some parallel working with our main platform to save time) and it has our MODEL (Word Model) 
3.	Third file " Sentiment Analysis without data cleaning" has the training and working on the model without cleaning.
