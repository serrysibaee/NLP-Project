# NLP-Project
The project for sentiment analysis for the course CS476 (Dr. Sakhr) 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this files are a bit messy because of the long print statements (SORRY :) ) 
!!!!!!!!!!!
The distribution of the files is as following: 
1.	Main file is "project work" where the main code.
2.	Second file is "File number 2" is where we did the LSTM (because we needed some parallel working with our main platform to save time) and it has our MODEL (Word Model) 
3.	Third file " Sentiment Analysis without data cleaning" has the training and working on the model without cleaning.
